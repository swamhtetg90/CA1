            </h1>
            <p>
                Do you know that <strong>5 million people die every year</strong> due to air pollution
                caused by burning fossil fuels? This is more than half of the 8 million deaths attributed to air
                pollution
                globally. The extensive use of non-renewable resources like coal and oil is creating an alarming health
                crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2023-077784" target="_blank">a study published
                    by BMJ</a>,
                many of
                these deaths could have been avoided if we had never relied on fossil fuels. The evidence is clear:
                reducing
                our dependency on these harmful energy sources is directly linked to a healthier, safer
                population.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a comprehensive study, researchers from around the world examined the impact of air pollution on
                human
                health. Their findings confirmed <strong>a strong link between fossil fuel use and
                    atmospheric pollution.</strong> This
                reinforces the urgent need to shift towards cleaner, renewable energy sources.

                    Transitioning to renewable energy not only saves lives but also promotes a more sustainable world.
                    This
                    is why the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) is so critical. It aims to ensure
                    access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, targeting to increase
                    substantially the share of renewable energy
                    in the global energy mix as in <strong>target 7.2.</strong>

            <p>Although air pollution remains a major threat to many countries, some nations such as <strong>Costa
                    Rica</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> have begun to
                utilise renewable energy resources to address the issue, aligning with UN SDG 7. Click on each tab to

                        years. Since 2014, the country has generated over 98% of its electricity from renewable sources,
                        making it one of the greenest nations on the planet. In 2021, Costa Rica continued its efforts
                        to remain carbon neutral, aiming to produce over 99% of its energy from renewable resources.
                        This commitment showcases Costa Rica's dedication to sustainability and serves as an inspiring
                        model for other countries.</p>

                        Germany aims to phase out coal by 2038, with new climate targets suggesting an even earlier

                        buildings almost entirely with renewables, proving that an industrialized nation can abandon
                        fossil fuels without sacrificing growth.</p>
